function R = cholinsert(R, x, X, delta)
%CHOLINSERT Fast update of Cholesky factorization of X'*X.
%   CHOLINSERT returns the Cholesky factorization of [X x]'*[X x] given a
%   Cholesky factorization R of X'*X.
%
%   R = CHOLINSERT(R, x, X) returns a matrix corresponding to R =
%   chol([X x]'*[X x]), the Cholesky factorization of X'*X where variable x
%   has been added to X. R is the current upper triangular matrix to be
%   updated, x is a column vector representing the variable to be added and
%   X is the data matrix containing the currently active variables (not
%   including x).
%
%   R = CHOLINSERT(R, x, X, delta) returns a matrix corresponding to R =
%   chol([X x]'*[X x] + delta*I), the Cholesky factorization of X'*X +
%   delta*I where variable x has been added to X. See ELASTICNET [2] for
%   uses of this option.
%
%   This function is an auxiliary part of SpaSM, a Matlab toolbox for
%   sparse modeling and analysis.
