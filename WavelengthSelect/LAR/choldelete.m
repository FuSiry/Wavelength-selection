function R = choldelete(R,j)
%CHOLDELETE Fast downdate of Cholesky factorization of X'*X.
%   CHOLDELETE returns the Cholesky factorization of the Gram matrix X'*X
%   where the jth column of X has been removed.
%
%   R = CHOLDELETE(R, j) returns a matrix corresponding to R =
%   chol(X2'*X2), where X2 is equal to X with the jth column taken out and
%   R = chol(X'*X) is the Cholesky factorization of X'*X to be downdated.
%
%   This function is an auxiliary part of SpaSM, a matlab toolbox for
%   sparse modeling and analysis.

%  See also CHOLINSERT.
